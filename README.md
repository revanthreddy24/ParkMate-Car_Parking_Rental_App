# ParkMate 🚗  
## FastAPI Parking Reservation Web App

ParkMate is a full-stack parking reservation web application built with **FastAPI**. It allows users to list parking spaces, browse available spots, book parking, and manage reservations through a simple web dashboard.

This project demonstrates practical backend engineering skills including **authentication, database modeling, CRUD operations, booking logic, protected routes, and server-side rendering**.

## Demo Workflow

1. Register as a parking owner.
2. Add a parking spot.
3. Logout and register/login as another user.
4. Browse available parking spots.
5. Book a parking spot.
6. View or cancel the booking from the dashboard.

## Database Models

The app uses three main database tables:

- **Users** — stores account details, roles, and hashed passwords
- **Parking Spots** — stores parking listing details such as title, address, city, price, and availability
- **Bookings** — stores reservation details, booking hours, total price, and booking status
